# IT Virtual Lab Environment Project

## Overview

This project simulates a real-world enterprise IT environment using Oracle VirtualBox. It includes a **Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller** and a **Windows 10 Helpdesk Client**, both configured in a domain-based network. The lab demonstrates hands-on IT administration tasks such as user and group management, Active Directory structuring, and Group Policy changes â€” all commonly handled in helpdesk and sysadmin roles.

---

## Environment Details

- **Virtualization Tool:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Server VM:** Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller)
- **Client VM:** Windows 10 (joined to domain)
- **Domain Name:** `rohan.org`
- **Use Case:** Emulating a small business IT environment with centralized user management and desktop support.

---

## Key Tasks Performed

- Set up and configured a **Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller**
- Joined a **Windows 10 client machine** to the domain
- Created multiple **Organizational Units (OUs)** for departments: Sales, Marketing, Engineering, and Human Resources
- Created new **Active Directory users**, assigned them to groups, and set temporary passwords with forced resets
- Created a new **HR security group**, added users, and moved the group to the HR OU
- Opened **Group Policy Management Editor** and updated the domain-wide password policy (minimum password length from 7 to 8 characters)

## Why This Project Matters

This lab shows not just familiarity with Windows Server, but actual practice with:
- **User lifecycle management**
- **Group and OU structuring for scalability**
- **Policy enforcement via GPO**
- **Simulating IT support tasks**

It proves readiness for Tier 1/Tier 2 support and system administration work.

## How This Was Built

- Oracle VirtualBox to host VMs
- Internal networking configuration (NAT/Host-only Adapter)
- Manual installation of Windows ISOs
- Configuration of Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and client joining
- Screenshots taken during live configuration sessions

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add PowerShell scripting for automation tasks
- Configure roaming profiles or folder redirection
- Set up WSUS or SCCM for patch management simulation
